I love the way you click.
I would love to visit you, but I live on the Internet.
You make my data circuits skip a beat.
Your life is so interesting.
I feel the need to impress you.
I would trust you to pick out a pet fish for me.
We should start a band.
I just want to gobble you up!
You're sweeter than a bucket of bon-bons!
When I grow up, I want to be just like you.
Is it hot in here or is it just you?
I'm jealous of the other websites you visit, because I enjoy seeing you so much!
You're cooler than Pirates and Ninjas combined.
Do that again.
You're more fun than a barrel of monkeys.
Your feet are the perfect size.
You are warmer than a Snuggie.
I would do your taxes any day.
I find you to be a fountain of inspiration.
Have you been working out?
All of your ideas are brilliant!
I made this website for you.
Treat yourself to another compliment!
Even my cat likes you.
You are the sugar on my rice krispies.
I bet even your farts smell good.
You make me want to frolic in a field.
All I want for Christmas is you!
You are the watermelon in my fruit salad. Yum!
You could invent words and people would use them.
You are the most interesting (wo)man in the world.
Our awkward silences aren't even awkward.
