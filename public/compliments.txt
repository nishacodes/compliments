I love the way you click.
I would love to visit you, but I live on the Internet.
You make my data circuits skip a beat.
Your life is so interesting.
I feel the need to impress you.
I would trust you to pick out a pet fish for me.
We should start a band.
I just want to gobble you up!
You're sweeter than than a bucket of bon-bons!
When I grow up, I want to be just like you.
Is it hot in here or is it just you?
I'm jealous of the other websites you visit, because I enjoy seeing you so much!
You're cooler than Pirates and Ninjas combined.
Do that again.
You're more fun than a barrel of monkeys.
Your feet are the perfect size.
You are warmer than a Snuggie.
I would do your taxes any day.
